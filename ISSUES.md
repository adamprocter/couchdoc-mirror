# Reporting Issues
Please review the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting an issue.
We are using the github mirror site to better capture all issues together. 
View and Create [issues](https://github.com/adamprocter/couchdoc-mirror/issues)

There is also some use of inline comments in the following formats to store thoughts and things to do.

// TODO: Test
// FIXME: Test
// HACK(Your Name): Test

These comments can then be viewed together as a list using the Todo List extension within VSCode.

Overarching comments could also be added to this document.
