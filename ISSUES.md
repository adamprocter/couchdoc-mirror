# Reporting Issues

Where possible use inline comments in the following formats to store issues and things to do.

// TODO: Test
// FIXME: Test
// HACK(Your Name): Test

The issues can then be viewed together as a list using the Todo List extension within VSCode.

Overarching issues should be added to this document.
