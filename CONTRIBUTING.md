# Coding Guidelines

Donâ€™t show off. Its ok if your code is verbose the easier to read, the _better_.

All code must fit into the GNU Affero General Public [License](LICENSE.md). Basic rule is free software all the way. 

All dependancies have to be loaded in via vue ui cli.

Components must follow the convention _FirstLast_ views are single words.

Use arrow functions !

All if statements should use curly braces to indicate statement block { }

Apply ESLint and Prettier to all code please.

## Problem solving



## Language
Vue.js


## Code organization

Use comments, in fact over use comments.
Feel free to retro add comments after a batch of code.
Use the following format to highlight concerns KEYWORD:Comment. For Example TODO:this needs to be amended to arrow functions.

## Framework

## User Interface
Now this is the exciting part, nodenoggin has been build to make this the most extensible part of the code base.
The data once connected to any instance can be rendered into a component and added to the Home.vue.


## Version Control

We use branches as features for everything. Please do not work from master, check out master and branch. Once work is completed request a merge, please note at this stage its your job to resolve conflicts.
